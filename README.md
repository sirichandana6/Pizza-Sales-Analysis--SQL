Pizza Sales Analysis Project üçï

This project analyzes pizza sales data from a fictional pizzeria using SQL. The data is stored in CSV files and imported into a MySQL database, Pizza_Hut, to gain insights into order patterns, revenue generation, and product popularity.

Project Overview
Key Steps
Data Import
Installed MySQL Server and Workbench for database setup and querying.
Imported CSV files as tables in the Pizza_Hut database. For smaller files, the MySQL Import Wizard was used; tables for larger datasets were created manually.

Data Analysis
Applied SQL queries to retrieve insights on sales metrics, customer preferences, and revenue patterns.
Used JOIN operations to combine data across multiple tables.

Total Revenue: Calculated total revenue generated from pizza sales.
Top-Priced Pizza: Identified the highest-priced pizza.
Popular Pizza Size: Determined the most commonly ordered pizza size.
